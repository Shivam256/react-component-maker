# react-component-maker
A simple but useful file to make components in react faster

If you have a habit like me to keep their react components jsx and styles file in their specific folder this project will be useful!

Usage:
put the create-componsnt.js file in the src folder of your react app or anywhere where you like to keep your components
on the cli run 
node create-component folder_name component_name 

this will create a folder wil your component name in the folder_name you provide and in that component folder you will have two filse:
1)component_name.component.jsx
2)componsnt_name.styles.css

if you are using scss add scss as an argument to the command

eg node create-component components custom-button scss


This will also provider you a boilerplate for jsx !
